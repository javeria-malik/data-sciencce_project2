#IRIS_DATASET
The Iris Classification Project is a simple example of a supervised machine learning task. It includes the following key components:

Data: The project utilizes the Iris dataset, a commonly used dataset in machine learning. It consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Machine Learning Model: The project employs the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm for classification. The K-NN algorithm predicts the species of an Iris flower based on the measurements and the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors in the training data.

Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix. These metrics help us understand how well the model is classifying the Iris species.
